# Natural Language Formality Translation VAE Project
 
 This project has been developed as part of the DTU course '02456 Deep Learning'. 
 
 The dataset is restricted and provided by Grammerly Inc. The description of the dataset is given in the paper [Dear Sir or Madam, May I Introduce the GYAFC Dataset:
Corpus, Benchmarks and Metrics for Formality Style Transfer](https://www.cs.rochester.edu/~tetreaul/style-transfer-naacl-final.pdf). The dataset may be requested for research purposes by following the description provided by the GYAFC github [link](https://github.com/raosudha89/GYAFC-corpus)

 The project is based on the LSTM-VAE model presented in the paper [Generating sentences from a continuous space](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1511.06349.pdf).

# Repo
The repository contain the three main folders:

``` Training Notebooks ``` folder include the models useing a combination of cyclic annealing (CA), Linear Anealing (LA), Word Dropout (WD) and free bits (FB).
``` Modules ``` folder include the general LSTM-VAE module and model specific functions
``` Trained models ``` folder include the internal model states (parameters) for the trained models.

# Examination comment
Since the dataset is restricted we can't upload Grammarlys data, so the code is not runable. 
Examiners - to get a demo contact us, and we will share our google colab with you.
